                    <p>Bat stars, also known as "sea bats," have a cool trick—if a bat star loses an arm, it can grow a new one, making it a fascinating example of nature's resilience. These sea stars come in a variety of vibrant colors, including orange, purple, and red, and are found along the Pacific coast of North America.</p>

                    <p>Black sea hares, also known as Aplysia vaccaria, are the largest species of sea slug in the world! They can grow up to 3 feet long and weigh over 30 pounds. Despite their size, they are harmless herbivores, feeding mainly on seaweed. When threatened, they can release a dark purple ink to confuse predators, similar to how octopuses defend themselves.</p>

                    <figcaption>Abalone</figcaption>
                    <p>Abalone, often called the "sea ear," has a unique shell with a row of small holes along one edge. These holes help the abalone with breathing, waste removal, and even reproduction! Plus, the inside of the shell is lined with stunning iridescent nacre, also known as mother-of-pearl.</p>

                    <figcaption>Red Anemone</figcaption>
                    <p>The red anemone, often called the "Windflower," is associated with Greek mythology. In the wild, its bright red petals are often a signal to pollinators like bees, but they also have a hidden defense—tiny stinging cells called nematocysts, just like their sea anemone relatives!</p>

                    <figcaption>Acorn Barnacle</figcaption>
                    <p>Acorn barnacles are tiny crustaceans that glue themselves to rocks, ships, and even whales using one of the strongest natural adhesives known. In fact, their "glue" is so strong that it can even withstand the pounding of ocean waves!</p>

                    <figcaption>Giant Keyhole Limpet</figcaption>
                    <p>The giant keyhole limpet (Megathura crenulata) is not only a fascinating marine mollusk, but it also plays a crucial role in biotechnology. Its blood contains a protein called hemocyanin, which is used in vaccines and cancer research!</p>

                    <figcaption>Hermit Crab</figcaption>
                    <p>Hermit crabs do not actually grow their own shells—they "borrow" empty shells from snails or other creatures and switch shells as they outgrow them. In fact, when a group of hermit crabs comes across a new, empty shell, they often line up by size and swap shells in a sort of "crab conga line"!</p>

                    <p>The striped shore crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes, is an excellent climber! These crabs are often found scaling vertical rocks and even trees near the shore. They're also known for their striking black and white striped legs, which help them blend in with their rocky surroundings.</p>
